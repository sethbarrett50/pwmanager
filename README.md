# Password Manager

This is a small password manager I made with my CYBR 5001 Student
To run:

1. Clone repo
2. Run `uv sync`
3. Use the commands below to run in either gui or cli mode
    - `make cli`: Runs password manager in cli mode
    - `make gui`: Runs password manager in gui mode

This project was done in conjunction with Joe Waddell. Its been crazy seeing him grow from no Python knowledge to being able to make something like this.
